# SPHS Key Club's Website (Old)

## Huh...?
The SPHS Key Club website was first created on Weebly - which its earliest snapshot on the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine was taken on September 13, 2016 (woah!!). For the 2024-2025 school year, a new SPHS Key Club website was created and published on Github Pages, which you can see [here](https://sphskeyclub.github.io/). However, to avoid confusion, I (zach rat) decided to unpublish the old website... but (!!!) , here are all the files to it - you can download this repository and still gaze upon the awesomeness of the old website!
## Thanks
